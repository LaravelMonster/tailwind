This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is my main repository of the flex boxes I created during my practice with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com).

For now it has been hosted at [https://tailwind.surge.sh](https://tailwind.surge.sh)

It contains a list of flex implemented boxes that I have found over the internet and are usefull in my projects. 

Needless to say, that it has been made by a developer (not designer), so there is a chance that you may not like color combinations or anything at all.

But, if you would like to contribute to this, please feel free to make PR.
